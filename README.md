====================


Note: This DOES NOT have some basic common sense security things in place.  Your password will be stored unencrypted in clear text locally and may be sent over the HTTP request if you are running this as standard node.js and don't provide an SSL cert. 

This is intended to be a functional DEMO.  Make sure when you implement to protect your passwords and secrets.
